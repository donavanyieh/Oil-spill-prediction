<b>Problem Description</b><br>
Oil spills have major environmental and economic effects, and can negatively affect human and marine health, often posing a threat to fishermen and surrounding homes. When dealing with oil spills, quick response is necessary. Being able to quickly detect oil spills can have use cases to mitigate evoke quick response to early warning signs.

<b>Objective</b><br>
Utilize convolutional neural networks to predict whether an image (may be of different sizes) contains oil spill or not.<br><br>
